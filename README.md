- Welcome to my Pokemon Team Builder for Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon OU, and eventually Sword and Shield OU.

- `pokemondatabuilder.py` is a program that lets you push both official and custom sets into a database called ` `.  Simply copy and paste directly from teambuilder or Smogon.com, press `enter` and then `^d` to run the program.  

- It returns the values for `species`, `item`, `level`, `ability`, `EV spread`, `nature`, `IV spread`, and a list for its last four moves called `moves`.  It will automatically set things to 'none' if they do not exist and remove extraneous information.
